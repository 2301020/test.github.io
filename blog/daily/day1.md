In the morning, Professor Morrison conducted a lecture on the importance of asking the right questions. This led our team decided to sit together and brainstorm some questions, mainly focusing on clarifying the questions that we had about the questions statement. <!-- truncate -->

Some of the questions we had are:
- Who is the target audience, who is going to use
-  What does river condition mean?
-  Are there any other data sources that we can use, other than SEPA as it seems limited.
-  What are the main concerns that we should be looking out for?

The partner meeting have helped us in clarifying and understanding what the whole project is about, we also got a chance to learn something new regarding the river through the talk we had with the partner. We were quite glad that we were able to used what we learnt in class to action and was able to drill down the problem statement to better understand the requirements.

During the meeting, we also gave out suggestions of possible solutions, which was an easy-to-use mobile application. While the partner was receptive to this idea, she also suggested we look into Information Display Systems that are used on beaches to tell the public basic information.

After the meeting, we decided to first consolidate our findings from the meeting into a list in order to prevent any one person from being out of the loop and ended the day there.
