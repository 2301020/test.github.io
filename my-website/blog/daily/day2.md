After the lecture, we came together and list out all possible ideas during a group discussion where we came with:

- Mobile Application
- Information Display System
- QR Code + Website

Even though we did not draw each ideas out, we did come togther and discuss the pros and cons of each idea. We focused mainly on the cost effectiveness and also usability of the ideas.

In the end, we chose to create a mobile application, as it was the most cost effective and is able to meet the requirements set by the partner. However, most importantly it will allow for quick and easy access to the information without the need of heading down to the actual river.
