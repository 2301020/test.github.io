While the partner was receptive to this idea, she also suggested we look into Information Display Systems that are used on beaches to tell the public basic information.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the meeting, we decided to first consolidate our findings from the meeting into a list in order to prevent any one person from being out of the loop and ended the day there."}]}}')}}]);
